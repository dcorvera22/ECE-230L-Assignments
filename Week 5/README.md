# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

| Summary Answers | We learned how we can apply Min and Maxterms in verilog. This made it possible to use adders in our logic and be able to connect the two logics together. | 25% |

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
The top level file is what is used to connect and call data from the files and logic we made in the other files. 
### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
The constraints file is useful in limiting the function of the board and only use what we will be using in our logic or code. 
### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
I do believe the selection was correct for each circuit and really wouldn't have chosen anything else.
