# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.
It's the file that directly interacts with our FPGA we're using and interacting using the relative circuit pathways via other files.
### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
It's code that enables the assignment of FPGA hardware, provided by the manufacturer usually through github.
### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?
