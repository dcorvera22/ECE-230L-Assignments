## Summary
We implemented many building blocks like D-Latches and Multiplexors to create memory. 
## Lab Questions

###  Why can we not just use structural Verilog to implement latches?
It just adds complexity and it is dfficult to model. 

### What is the meaning of always @(*) in a sensitivity block?
It means combination logic that makes the block be re-evaluated immediately after the inputs change. 

### What importance is memory to digital circuits?
It is hugely important as it can store states and call those past states into action.
