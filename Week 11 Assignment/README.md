## Summary
We designed a logic that could be used to act as a JK flip flop, T flip flop, and D flip flop.

## Lab Questions

### What is different between edge and level sensitive circuits?
Edge sensitive circuits react to the change in the clock's signal state, while edge sensitive circuits react to a specific voltage level. 

### Why is it important to declare initial state?
It is important so the circuit knows what state the voltage is to react to. 

### What do edge sensitive circuits let us build?
It allows us to build memory registers, counters, latches and flip flops.
